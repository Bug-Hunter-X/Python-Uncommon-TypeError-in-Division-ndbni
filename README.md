This repository demonstrates an example of an uncommon error in Python related to division.  The main script, bug.py, shows a function that handles the common ZeroDivisionError but also encounters a TypeError when attempting to divide an integer by a string. This scenario might be easily missed during development.  The solution, in bugSolution.py, provides a more robust check to avoid the TypeError by checking the data type beforehand.
